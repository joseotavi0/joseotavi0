I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a keen interest in technology, UX design, and front-end development. I love exploring new ideas and finding creative solutions to complex problems.

⚡️ Fun facts...  
I'm an avid gamer, enjoying everything from PC gaming to consoles and board games, and I'm always up for a new challenge. When I'm not immersed in gaming, you'll find me exploring the latest smartphones and other tech devices, or delving into football (Cruzeiro-br and Manchester City-uk are my teams). Additionally, I have a keen interest in politics and love learning about different cultures and their histories.

## 🔎 Current Focus
Right now, I'm on a journey to become a full-stack developer. I'm diving deep into both front-end and back-end technologies, honing my skills in areas like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and databases. Additionally, I'm fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence and how it can positively impact our world, so I'm dedicating time to learning more about AI technologies and their applications.
