# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jose Otavio

## About Me
I'm a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in technology, gaming, UX design, and front-end development. I love exploring new ideas and finding creative solutions to complex problems.

## Current Focus
Right now, I'm on a journey to become a full-stack developer. I'm diving deep into both front-end and back-end technologies, honing my skills in areas like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and databases. Additionally, I'm fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence and how it can positively impact our world, so I'm dedicating time to learning more about AI technologies and their applications.
