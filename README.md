# Hi there! üëã I'm Jose Otavio

## üöÄ About me
I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a special interest in Flutter and mobile development. I love exploring new ideas and finding creative solutions to complex problems, with a strong focus on building seamless and engaging user experiences.

‚ö°Ô∏è Fun facts...  
I'm an avid gamer, enjoying everything from PC gaming to consoles and board games, and I'm always up for a new challenge. When I'm not immersed in gaming, you'll find me exploring the latest smartphones and other tech devices, or delving into football (Cruzeiro-br and Manchester City-uk are my teams). Additionally, I have a keen interest in politics and love learning about different cultures and their histories.

üòÑ Pronouns...  
He/him.
